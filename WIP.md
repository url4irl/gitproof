## Development Notes

1. **Authentication**: Basic structure is in place, but full authentication implementation is pending.

2. **Error Handling**: All API endpoints include proper error handling and validation.

3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode enabled.

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **View the dashboard**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard

3. **Test API endpoints** using curl or a tool like Postman:
   ```bash
   # Get dashboard stats
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/stats
   
   # List providers
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/providers
   ```

4. **Explore the database**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Git-Proof backend system. The architecture is scalable, maintainable, and ready for additional features.
